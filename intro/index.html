        <h1>Introductory  Questions:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is Emily and I'm a junior studying communication design with minors in psychology and HCI</li>
            <li>Though initially mainly into illustration and painting, I've come to appreciate digital media and 
                screen based designs. I am now more interested in concentrating on interaction design and want to be 
                more familiar with HTML/CSS and web development.</li>
            <li>I have taken Web Develpment</li>
            <li>I would like to learn how to incorporate creativity and aesthetics into a website  </li>
            <li>Making mistakes on paper is more forgiving, as code has to be precise and accurate in order to work</li>
            <li>I think a website that exemplifies good design is the <a href="https://monsido.com/tools/contrast-checker">Monsido Color Contrast Checker.</a> 
                because it's very straightforward and the goal is clear. There is no element that is extra, and everything on the site serves a purpose. It is intuitive to use </li>
            <li>I think <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3 Schools</a> has effective communication. The user can pick the language on home page, and once inside,
                the side navigation is very clear in showing the categories the user can learn from. </li>
            <li>I think a website that works well is <a href= "https://www.notion.so/product?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=2075789710&utm_medium=93936782054&utm_content=495341254023&utm_term=notion%20so&targetid=kwd-654800325249&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjbyYBhCdARIsAArC6LLFQ6nNkmn7hFUZsmAVK2qR-MPBG9jMidU9_D8Ks65mA6rDQadVNX0aAupVEALw_wcB">Notion's website</a>. It is very minimal and clean which is consistent with their overall
                branding, and the site stucture is neat and intuitive despite there being a lot of information.
