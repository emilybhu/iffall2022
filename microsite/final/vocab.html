        <h2 class="word">Artificial General Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="word">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
        </p>
        <h2 class="word">Computational Theory of Mind</h2>
        <p>In philosophy of mind, the computational theory of mind, also known as computationalism, is a family of views that hold that the human mind is an information processing system and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of computation</p>
        
        <h2 class="word">Consciousness</h2>
        <p>Artificial consciousness (also known as machine consciousness or synthetic consciousness or AI consciousness) refers to a non-biological, human created machine that is aware of its own existence. When – or if – it will be created, it will profoundly affect our understanding of what it means to be “alive”.

        </p>
        
        <h2 class="word">Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, especially when considered as an academic discipline.
        </p>
        <h2 class="word">Strong AI</h2>
        <p>
            Strong Artificial Intelligence(AI) is an artificial intelligence that constructs mental abilities, thought processes, and functions that are impersonated from the human brain. It is more of a philosophical rather than practical approach.
        </p>
        <h2 class="word">Symbolic Processing</h2>
        <p>
            It refers to any attempt to create AI using conventional programming language means or at a high level. Symbols are kind of like variables, they can refer to one thing at one moment and another at another        </p>
        <h2 class="word">Turing Test</h2>
        <p>a test for intelligence in a computer, requiring that a human being should be unable to distinguish the machine from another human being by using the replies to questions put to both.
        </p>
        <h2 class="word">Weak AI</h2>
        <p>Weak artificial intelligence is artificial intelligence that implements a limited part of mind, or, as narrow AI, is focused on one narrow task. In John Searle's terms it “would be useful for testing hypotheses about minds, but would not actually be minds”
