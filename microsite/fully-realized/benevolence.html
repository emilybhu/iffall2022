            Overview
        </h2>
        <p class="intro">
            This question (like many others in the philosophy of artificial intelligence) can be presented in two forms. "Hostility" can be defined in terms function or behavior, in which case "hostile" becomes synonymous with "dangerous". Or it can be defined in terms of intent: can a machine "deliberately" set out to do harm? The latter is the question "can a machine have conscious states?" (such as intentions) in another form. Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions. The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.

    <p>Will a machine show benevolence?</p>

    <h2>YES</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence".       </p>

    <h2>NO</h2>
    <p class="intro">
         The way artificial intelligence can be bad varies a lot. It can create autonomous weapons, can cause social manipulation via social media, invasion of privacy due to cameras that can be found everywhere and facial recognition algorithms, and so on. According to Physicist Stephen Hawking, artificial intelligence could be the "worst event in the history of our civilization."

         Stephen Hawking is one of the people who think artificial intelligence can bring evil to our lives. He once said, "Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. It could bring great disruption to our economy."
