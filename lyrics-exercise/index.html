<h1>Swim</h1>
<h2>Adoy</h2>
<div>
<p>I think of you <br>
    When I am sad and down <br>
    When the silence makes me cry <br>
    When it's hard to try <br>
    I simply fall back into you <br>
</p>

<p>
    I think of you <br>
    When I am safe and sound <br>
    When the universe is kind <br>
    When the stars align <br> 
    I can't help but to fall back into you <br>
</p>
<p>
    I think of you <br>
    When you are not around <br>
    When the angels go to fly <br>
    When it's cold and dry <br>
    I simply fall back into you
</p>
